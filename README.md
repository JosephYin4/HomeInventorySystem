Design Process

We wanted to design an application to help homeowners create an inventory list for their household items.

Brainstorming on how to classify all household items, we have concluded that all household items can be classified to either a Big Item or Small Item based on its weight
and size.

As we are using Java programming to create this application, we have set the similar household item properties such as (Item ID, Item Name, Item Quantity, Price Per Item
and Estimated Lifespan of Item) as a parent class and the child classes as BigItem and SmallItem. For BigItem class, we has 2 properties(Weight and Size) to differentiate it
from SmallItem class's 1 property(WhereToFindIt).

We have also brainstormed of 2 important methods which we have added to the Home Inventory System application. The first is the calculateTotalInventoryCost method to calculate
and display the total inventory items costs or value and the second is the calculateEstimatedCostToReplaceItemYearly method to calculate and display the estimated cost to 
replace a certain household item on a yearly basis.
